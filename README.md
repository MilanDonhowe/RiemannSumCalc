# RiemannSumCalc
Command line java app to evaluate Riemann Sums!

This is still in active development and currently very buggy.

## Usage
```RiemannSum mode "function" subdivisions startPoint endPoint```

Example: ```RiemannSum m "x^2+5" 5 -4 10```
Calculates the midpoint sum for "x^2+5" from -4 to 10 using 5 rectangles.
